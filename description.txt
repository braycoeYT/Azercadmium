Welcome to the Azercadmium Mod! We’ll spare you the whole generic description and cut straight to the chase: This mod doesn’t strive to fit in with vanilla, and it’s more of a giant passion project, where we add what we think is interesting. Have fun!
Note: The wiki is really outdated.

Update V0.3: Update
Ever since work on the next big update was started, the mod began to die. The changes started as unnoticeable but now the mod is in the crippled state it is now. Maybe someday the mod will return to the good times, but for now, no more big updates. The content planned for the original 0.3 will either be scrapped or put in future updates.
~Resprited Ocean Piercer.
~Added Palladium Chair.
~Zinc ore now generates at about the same rate as Lead ore.
~Dirtboi's tears are now more accurately positioned.
~Reworked Titan Tankorb.

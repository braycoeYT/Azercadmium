This mod has unique content, including ore furniture and a new subclass.
This mod also has QoL changes, such as an easier Slime Crown recipe, crimson alternates, tons of vanilla recipes, and some hardmode enemies dropping prehardmode loot.
Make sure to check the config every once in a while!
The reworks have finally been completed! It has been a lot time since September, but we finally did it!

Update V0.2.8.4: Devastation Update
~Added a new leveling system for devastation mode, in which killing enemies increases your devastation points. Reaching your max devastation points increases your devastation level. To prevent this from being too overpowered, there is a cap to the maximum level, which can be increased by killing certain bosses. A special device sold by the Engineer and the Goblin Tinkerer allows you to track your stats.
~Fixed an issue with the Braycoe Town NPC shop.

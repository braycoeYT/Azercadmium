Welcome to the Azercadmium Mod! We’ll spare you the whole generic description and cut straight to the chase: This mod doesn’t strive to fit in with vanilla, and it’s more of a giant passion project, where we add what we think is interesting. Have fun!
DON'T USE THE WIKI! And make sure to get the music mod for music.

Looking for help/support/feedback.

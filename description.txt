The best Terraria mod that starts with Aze, or your money back, guaranteed!
This mod has unique content, including ore furniture and a new subclass.
This mod also has QoL changes, such as an easier Slime Crown recipe, crimson alternates, tons of vanilla recipes, and some hardmode enemies dropping prehardmode loot.
Some changes can be only accessed via the config, like the Pearlwood buff.
Most of the reworks are complete, but Empress Slime still needs to be improved.
